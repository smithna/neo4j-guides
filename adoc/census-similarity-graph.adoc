= Build a similarity graph from US Census Bureau Data

== A similarity graph

The concept of *similarity* lies at the heart of cluster analysis.
The Neo4j Graph Data Science library gives us tools for discovering
the similarity between nodes in a dataset based on the node's properties,
*even if there aren't preexisting relationships in our data.*

This guide will walk you through a tutorial using the Neo4j database and
the Bloom graph visualization tool. Click the pin at the top right of this
cell to freeze its position as you work through the tutorial.

== Census data

For this tutorial, we'll use data about metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)
from the https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html[2019
American Community Survey five-year estimates] provided by the United States
Census Bureau.

We'll use four demographic features to describe each MSA:

* population,
* median household income,
* median home price, and
* the percent of the population over age 25 with a bachelors degree.

In this tutorial, we will use a similarity algorithm to identify pairs of MSAs that are similar based on the four demographic features.
Then, we will use the similarity relationships to identify clusters of MSAs.

== Create a constraint

Before we load data, we should create a unique constraint for the name of the MSA.
This will speed up data loading and make the MSA name searchable in Bloom.

Click on the cell below to copy the code into a new Browser cell, and then run it.

[source,cypher]

CREATE CONSTRAINT msa_name ON (m:MSA) ASSERT m.name IS UNIQUE

== Load data

Use this command to load the MSA data from a CSV file on GitHub.

[source,cypher]
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smithna/datasets/main/CensusDemographicsByMetroArea.csv" AS row
WITH row WHERE row.name CONTAINS 'Metro'
MERGE (m:MSA {name:row.name})
SET m.population = toInteger(row.population),
m.medianHouseholdIncome = toInteger(row.medianHouseholdIncome),
m.medianHomePrice = toInteger(row.medianHomePrice),
m.percentOver25WithBachelors = toFloat(row.percentOver25WithBachelors)
RETURN m

Note that the LOAD CSV utility treats every field as a string, so we use
toInteger() and toFloat() functions to convert the numeric values to the
appropriate data type. After running the command, you should see that
MSA nodes have been created.

== Euclidean distance
Unlike most Neo4j projects, _we don't have any relationships to load at the start._
Instead, we're going to use the Graph Data Science library to discover similar
nodes and create relationships between them.

We'll define similarity based on *Euclidean distance*. The Euclidean distance
formula is an extension of the Pythagorean theorem, which says that the square
of the length hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares
of the other two sides.

image::pythagorean_theorem.png[Pythagorean theorem,299,167]

In our case, we are comparing MSAs along four dimensions instead of two, but
the concept is similar. The Euclidean distance between two MSAs is the square
root of the sum of the squared differences along each of our demographic metrics.

image::euclidean_distance_formula.png[Euclidean distance formula,662,72]

== Check property distributions

Before we calculate distance, we'll want each of our four properties to have
roughly the same range from the smallest value to the largest value. If there
is a big difference in the ranges, then the properties with a big range will
dominate the distance calculation; the properties with a small range will hardly
influence the distance calculation at all. So we need to normalize all of them
onto the same range.

Run this query to see the range of values for each of the four properties that
we loaded.

[source,cypher]

MATCH (n)
WITH n,
["population", "medianHouseholdIncome", "medianHomePrice", "percentOver25WithBachelors" ] AS metrics
UNWIND metrics as metric
WITH metric, n[metric] AS value
RETURN metric, min(value) AS minValue,
percentileCont(value, 0.25) AS percentile25,
percentileCont(value, 0.50) AS percentile50,
percentileCont(value, 0.75) AS percentile75,
max(value) AS maxValue

== Property histograms

The range of populations goes from 54,773 to 19,294,236. That's a huge
difference from the range of percent of people over 25 with a college degree,
which runs from 12.9 to 67.4.

We can also see that there is a much bigger difference between the 50th and
75th percentile for population (336,612 citizens) than there is between the
25th and 50th percentile (94,771.25 citizens).

Look at the histograms below that show the distributions of each property
on both a standard scale and a logarithmic scale.

image::population.jpg[Population histogram,724,289]
image::income.jpg[Income histogram,724,284]
image::homePrice.jpg[Home price histogram,724,289]
image::education.jpg[Education histogram,724,289]

== Transform the data

All of our metrics look like they approach a more normal distribution if we
apply a log transformation. This makes sense to me on an intuitive level when
I consider that adding 10,000 residents to an MSA with a population of 60,000
would be a big change to the character of the metro area, but adding 10,000
residents to an MSA with a population of 19 million would make a much smaller
impact. On the other hand, a 10% change in population would be noticeable in
an MSA of any scale.

Run the command below to apply a log transformation to all four properties.

[source,cypher]

MATCH (m:MSA)
SET
m.logPopulation = log(m.population),
m.logMedianHouseholdIncome = log(m.medianHouseholdIncome),
m.logMedianHomePrice = log(m.medianHomePrice),
m.logPercentOver25WithBachelors = log(m.percentOver25WithBachelors)

== MinMax scaler

The MinMax scaler in the Graph Data Science library will apply the formula
below to rescale each property value. The minimum value is set to 0, the
maximum value is set to 1, and all other values fall between 0 and 1
proportionally to their positions in the original data set.

image::min_max_formula.png[MinMax scaler formula,419,96]

== Create in-memory graph

We'll create an in-memory graph called "metro-graph" to efficiently perform the
scaling calculation on all the nodes at once. We will load all nodes with the
label MSA into the in-memory graph. Since we don't have any relationships in
our graph yet, we will use a * wildcard as a placeholder.

[source,cypher]

CALL gds.graph.create('msa-graph',
'MSA',
'*',
{nodeProperties:["logPopulation", "logMedianHouseholdIncome", "logMedianHomePrice", "logPercentOver25WithBachelors"]})

== Run MinMax scaler

Run the command below to create a new property in the in-memory graph called
scaledProperties. The new property will be a vector (an ordered list) of four
values: population, medianHouseholdIncome, medianHomePrice,
percentOver25WithBachelors.

The MinMax scaler will be applied to each property before it is added to the
vector, so that all the values are within the range [0, 1].

[source,cypher]

call gds.alpha.scaleProperties.mutate('msa-graph',
{nodeProperties: ["logPopulation", "logMedianHouseholdIncome", "logMedianHomePrice", "logPercentOver25WithBachelors"],
scaler:"MinMax",
mutateProperty: "scaledProperties"})
YIELD nodePropertiesWritten

== Write properties to Graph

Now we'll write those new properties from the in-memory graph back out to the
main Neo4j graph.

[source,cypher]

CALL gds.graph.writeNodeProperties('msa-graph',['scaledProperties'])

== Create IS_SIMILAR relationsihps

We can use scaledProperties that we just created to calculate the distance
between the nodes in our graph with the Euclidean distance procedure from the
Graph Data Science library. The topK parameter tells the algorithm to create
a relationship called IS_SIMILAR from each node to its 12 nearest neighbors.

[source,cypher]

MATCH (m:MSA)
WITH COLLECT({item:id(m), weights:m.scaledProperties}) AS data
CALL gds.alpha.similarity.euclidean.write({data:data, topK:12, writeRelationshipType:"IS_SIMILAR", writeProperty:"distance"})
YIELD similarityPairs, min, max, mean, p50
RETURN similarityPairs, min, max, mean, p50

== Create similarity property

The Euclidean distance algorithm tells us _how far apart_ MSAs are in 4-dimensional
space. _The higher the value_ of the distance property, _the less similar_ the two MSAs
are. We'll calculate a new similarity property by subtracting the distance from 1.
We can see that the maximum distance was about 0.5, so we'll always get a positive
value for similarity. _The higher the value_ of the similarity property, _the more similar_
two MSAs are.

[source,cypher]

MATCH (:MSA)-[s:IS_SIMILAR]->(:MSA)
SET s.similarity = 1 - s.distance

== Rank the IS_SIMILAR relationships

We added IS_SIMILAR relationships for the top 12 most similar MSAs to each MSA
node. It might be convenient to be able to filter those relationships to the
top 5 or some other top k. Run this query to add a ranking property to the
relationships.

[source,cypher]

MATCH (m:MSA)-[s:IS_SIMILAR]->()
WITH m, s ORDER BY s.similarity DESC
WITH m, collect(s) as similarities, range(0, 11) AS ranks
UNWIND ranks AS rank
WITH rank, similarities[rank] AS rel
SET rel.rank = rank + 1

== Open Neo4j Bloom

Now let's take a look at our graph in the Bloom graph visualization
application. Since this is our first time using Bloom with this dataset,
click on "Create Perspective." Then, click "Generate Perspective to let
Bloom set up a perspective for you. Finally, click on your newly generated
perspective to enter the Bloom scene.

image::bloom_perspective.png[Choose Bloom perspective,399,292]

== Configure IS_SIMILAR relationships

Let's configure the display of the "IS_SIMILAR" relationships so that the
line weight corresponds to the similarity of the nodes. Click Relationships
on the panel at the right of the screen, and then click the line next to the
"IS_SIMILAR" relationship.

In the fly-out menu that appears, choose "Rule-based." Then, click the plus
sign to add a new rule-based style.

Choose "similarity" from the property key drop down. Select the radio button
for "range."" Click the "Size" button to create a rule that will control
line weight. Toggle the button to apply the size rule.

In the Minpoint box, enter 0.2 and set the minimum size to 0.25x. In the
Maxpoint box, enter 1 and set the maximum size to 4x. Your configuration
should look like the picture below.

image::style_is_similar.png[Style IS_SIMILAR relationships,419,300]

== Search for MSAs similar to New York

Now, let's use Bloom to search for an MSA and its closest peers. If you start
typing "New York" in the Bloom search box, Bloom's auto-complete should suggest
the "New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metro Area."" Press tab to accept
the suggestion. Once you have a node for New York's MSA, Bloom will auto-suggest
patterns involving that node. Choose the pattern that extends from the New York
node with an IS_SIMILAR relationship, and press enter.

Bloom will return a visualization showing the New York MSA and its 12 most
similar MSAs based on the four demographic measures that we used.

== Filter the IS_SIMILAR Relationships

Let's filter the display to see the top 5 most similar cities to New York.
Click the funnel icon on the left of the Bloom screen to expand the filter
panel. Choose IS_SIMILAR in the dropdown. Select the "rank" property. Select
the "less than or equal to" condition, and set the value to 5. Toggle "Apply
Filter" to highlight the top 5 strongest similarity relationships for New York.

== Create a new in-memory graph

Now we will use the IS_SIMILAR relationships to detect communities within the
graph. Create a new in-memory graph that contains the MSA nodes and the
IS_SIMILAR relationships. We also want to include the similarity property on the
relationships.

[source,cypher]

CALL gds.graph.create('msa-similarity',
'MSA',
'IS_SIMILAR',
{relationshipProperties: ['similarity']}
)

== Run the Louvain algorithm

Now, we will execute the Louvain community detection algorithm against
the in-memory graph and write the community ids back to the main Neo4j graph.
We tell the algorithm to use the similarity property to weight the
relationships between nodes. By setting the consecutiveIds parameter to
true, we tell the algorithm that we want the values of the communityId property
that are generated to be consecutive integers.

[source,cypher]

CALL gds.louvain.write('msa-similarity',
{relationshipWeightProperty:"similarity",
 writeProperty:"communityId",consecutiveIds:true})
YIELD communityCount, modularities
RETURN communityCount, modularities

== Get community statistics

Run the query below to gather summary statistics about the communities we have
defined. In addition to statistics, we're adding context by listing the three
MSAs in each community with the highest similarity to other MSAs in the same
community. These MSAs should be typical examples of their community, as opposed
to other MSAs that might have fewer or weaker in-community relationships.

[source,cypher]

MATCH (m:MSA)
WITH m
ORDER BY apoc.coll.sum([(m)-[s:IS_SIMILAR]->(m2)
WHERE m.communityId = m2.communityId | s.similarity]) desc
RETURN m.communityId as communityId,
count(m) as msaCount,
avg(m.population) as avgPopulation,
avg(m.medianHomePrice) as avgHomePrice,
avg(m.medianHouseholdIncome) as avgIncome,
avg(m.percentOver25WithBachelors) as avgPctBachelors,
collect(m.name)[..3] as exampleMSAs
ORDER BY avgPopulation DESC

== Name the communities

Let's give the communities names that are more human friendly than the
auto-generated ids. Feel free to choose names that make sense to you.

[source,cypher]

MATCH (m:MSA)
  SET m.communityName = CASE m.communityId
  WHEN 1 THEN "Large metros"
  WHEN 3 THEN "Medium metros"
  WHEN 5 THEN "Medium high-cost metros"
  WHEN 4 THEN "College towns"
  WHEN 2 THEN "Small middle-income metros"
  WHEN 0 THEN "Small low-income metros"
  END
return m.communityName, m.communityId, count(*)

== Index community names

To make the communityName property searchable in Bloom, create an index on that property.

[source,cypher]

CREATE INDEX msa_community_name IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (m:MSA)
ON (m.communityName)

== Refresh Bloom perspective

Let's take a look at the results in Bloom. We'll configure the perspective to reflect the new
communities we have added. Click the icon in the top left of the screen to open the perspectives
panel. Then, click the database icon to refresh the perspective to include the new communityName
property we added to the database.

image::refresh_perspective.png[Refresh Bloom perspective,650,255]

== Style MSA node color

In the panel on the right side of the screen, click on the circle next to MSA to style the MSA
nodes. In the fly-out menu that appears, choose "Rule-based." Then, click the plus sign to add
a new rule-based style. Choose "communityName" from the property key drop down. Select the
radio button for "unique values." Toggle the button to apply the color rule.

Your rule should look like this.

image::style_msa.png[Style MSA node color,406,300]

== Style MSA node size

Let's add a second conditional style to set the size of the nodes based on population. Click the
plus to add a new rule-based styling rule.

Choose "population" from the property-key drop down. Select the radio button for "range." Click
the "size" button to create a rule that will control node size. Toggle the button to apply the
size rule.

In the Minpoint box, enter 55000 and set the minimum size to 1x. In the Maxpoint box, enter
19000000 and set the maximum size to 4x. Your configuration should look like the box below.

image::msa_node_size.png[Style MSA node size,414,300]

== Explore college towns

Now right click and choose "Clear Scene" from the context menu. In the search box, type "College towns"
and press enter. Among the results that are returned are the State College, PA Metro, the Ithaca, NY
Metro, the Champaign-Urbana, IL Metro, and the Charlottesville, VA Metro. Those metro areas are home to
Pennsylvania State University, Cornell University, the University of Illinois, and the University of
Virginia. Based on what we know of those metro areas, it seems like the algorithm has picked up some
clear commonalities.

Let's see which other metros are most similar to the college towns. Click Command-A to select all the
nodes. Then right click one of the nodes and chose Expand: <-IS_SIMILAR- from the context menu.

== Further exploration

Experiment with this dataset to explore similarity graphs further. Decreasing the number of similarity
relationships created by decreasing the topK parameter or setting the similarityThreshold parameter
when you run gds.alpha.similarity.euclidean will tend to result in more communities when you run
gds.louvain. Try scalers other than MinMax when you run gds.alpha.scaleProperties.

The graph data science library supports several other similarity algorithms. The K-Nearest Neighbors
algorithm provides an efficient way to generate links based on cosine similarity.

Louvain community detection is one option among several community detection algorithms. See how different
your results are by running the Label Propagation algorithm.

The data CSV on GitHub includes micropolitan statistical areas in addition to metropolitan statistical
areas. Remove WHERE row.name INCLUDES 'Metro' from the LOAD CSV script to load these nodes and explore
their properties.

You'll find that graphs _really are everywhere,_ even when relationships are not apparent in the data
model at first.
